## Getting Started
Since this is installed with Makefile, you can easily install it in two easy steps.

1. Clone this repository with:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nvttles/riip
    cd riip
    ```
2. Run a 'make install' command:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
If the second step runs successfully, you have just installed riip, and can run it from anywhere with the riip command.
